Typing Race Game (Skeleton)
================================

This repository is a *skeleton* C project for a Typing Race game using SDL2.

To build (if SDL2 and sdl2-config are installed):

    make

Run the program:

    ./typing_race

At the moment, the .c files only contain skeleton comments and no logic.
You will implement the game in the src/ files.

SDL2 note:
- On macOS with Homebrew you may need to install SDL2 via:
    brew install sdl2
